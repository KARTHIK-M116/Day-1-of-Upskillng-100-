## ðŸ“… Day 1: Python Variables & Band Name Generator ðŸŽ¸

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- Introduction to **Python Variables**
  - Assigning values to variables
  - Variable naming rules
  - Data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
  - Concatenation and f-strings for formatted output

### ðŸŽ¯ Mini Project: Band Name Generator
#### **Objective:**
A simple Python script that generates a cool band name by combining user inputs.

#### **How It Works:**
1. The program asks for the userâ€™s city name.
2. The program asks for the userâ€™s petâ€™s name.
3. It then combines them to generate a unique band name.

#### **Code:**
```python
# Band Name Generator
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator!")

# Getting user inputs
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? ")
pet = input("What's your pet's name? ")

# Generating the band name
band_name = city + " " + pet

# Displaying the result
print("Your band name could be: " + band_name)
```

### ðŸ”¥ Key Takeaways
- **`input()` function** for user interaction
- **String concatenation** using `+`
- **Printing output** with `print()`
